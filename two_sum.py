"""
This class provides a solution for finding two numbers in a given list that add up to a target value.

Methods:
- twoSum(nums, target): Finds two numbers in the given list that add up to the target value and returns their indices as a list.

Parameters:
- nums (List[int]): The list of numbers to search for pairs.
- target (int): The target value that the pairs should add up to.

Returns:
- List[int]: The indices of the two numbers that add up to the target value. If no such pair is found, an empty list is returned.
